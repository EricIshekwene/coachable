right panel breakdown
Sidebar breakdown


Draggable Background
    In the middle div in app.jsx there will be an open space when users can create plays. I Imported an object an object in the field and that should by default be placxed on the screen and by using the hand tool (Sidebar.jsx) and the right panel field settings the user should be able to manipulate how the field looks.


Develop a p plan on how to breakdown the right panel and what infor we are sending to the app.jsx component

The name component needs to be brorcken down and esnt up
the filed setting actions and the currenrt zoom needs to be sent up you can break this into one component you dont have to break down every button

the players componment needs to be brocken down. The component needs to takew in an ovbject thaqt will break down players also i will have to link this with what my player pobject look like later but now i thinlk the object will have player position id name asiisgnemtn color etc. then the playber button take in id, color number and name if there is a nme and assignment if thewre is an assignment.

The is open state for the advance setting should be sent up. this component should be brocken down to advanced sertting button

All players should be brcken down tasking in th esame object for represented players and then i should be these should be size color show number and show name

then also send up save to playbook and downlaod but it should just be a button action i will hook this up to something later 

Alos reading the rest of the project iff there is aother neccessary informationthat needs to be sent up or brocken doiwn please feel free to do so
